# 🚀 VSD BabySoC Design & Verification Workshop  
### *A Complete RTL-to-GLS Journey (Week 0 to Week 3)*  

---

## 📘 Overview  

This repository documents my complete hands-on journey in the **VSD BabySoC** open-source SoC design workshop.  
Each week focuses on a key phase of the ASIC design flow — from environment setup and RTL simulation to post-synthesis gate-level verification.
