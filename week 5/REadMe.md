# üöÄ Week 5 ‚Äî Mastering OpenROAD Flow: Installation, Floorplan, and Placement

## üåü RISC-V SoC Tapeout Adventure

Welcome to the electrifying **Week 5** of the **RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program**! This week, you're diving into the exhilarating world of **backend physical design** using the cutting-edge **OpenROAD Flow Scripts (ORFS)** ‚Äî an open-source, fully automated RTL-to-GDSII system that transforms your digital dreams into silicon reality. üõ†Ô∏è‚ú®

Here, you'll conquer the **installation of OpenROAD**, execute the **Floorplan** and **Placement** stages, and witness your design take physical form. Buckle up for a thrilling ride from abstract netlists to geometric layouts! üé¢

---

## üéØ Mission Objective

Your goal is to establish the **OpenROAD Flow Scripts** environment, validate it, and run the **Floorplan** and **Placement** phases on a sample design (like the trusty `gcd` using the Nangate45 PDK). This is your leap from transistor-level circuits (Week 4) to **physical chip realization**, where logic gates morph into tangible silicon layouts.

---

## üß† Why This Matters

After mastering CMOS behavior with SPICE, you're now stepping into the arena of **physical design automation**. This week equips you with the skills to:

- Define **die and core dimensions** during floorplanning.
- Optimize **standard cell placement** for area and timing.
- Harness **OpenROAD‚Äôs automation** to streamline backend design.

By the end, you'll see how your circuits evolve into a structured, silicon-ready layout! üåç

```bash
./build_openroad.sh --local
```

| **Parameter**        | **Description**                           |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `--local`            | Builds binaries locally without Docker    |

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting Build Errors

If `./build_openroad.sh --local` fails, tweak the `CMakeLists.txt` in `tools/OpenROAD/`:

1. **Open the File**:
   ```bash
   nano tools/OpenROAD/CMakeLists.txt
   ```

2. **Key Modifications**:
   - Ensure `target_compile_definitions` includes `GPU` and `BUILD_PYTHON=0` (if not using Python).
   - Comment out `add_subdirectory(test)` to skip tests.
   - For GCC ‚â• 9.1, remove `stdc++fs` linking to avoid errors.

3. **Re-run Build**:
   ```bash
   ./build_openroad.sh --local
   ```

| **Error**                    | **Fix**                                  |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Missing `stdc++fs`           | Remove `link_libraries(stdc++fs)`        |
| Test Build Failure           | Disable `add_subdirectory(test)`         |
| Compiler Version Mismatch    | Adjust version checks in CMakeLists.txt  |
